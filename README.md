## Hey! I'm Dillon.

I like to make things. 

Most of my projects are in C++ (my favorite language) and Python, but I've been enjoying writing in Uiua recently. I'd like to learn some Rust as well.

If you're curious, check out my [Uiua mesh library](https://github.com/dguto9/meshing-around), check out [black-hole pong](https://github.com/dguto9/gravitational-lensing) or my attempt at designing a [modular guitar amplifier](https://github.com/dguto9/modular-amp).

Dguto9/Dguto9 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
