## Hey! I'm Dillon.

I like to make things. 

Most of my projects are in C++ (my favorite language) and Python, but I've been enjoying writing in Uiua recently. I'd like to learn some Rust as well.

If you're curious, here's my [mesh rendering library for Uiua](https://github.com/dguto9/meshing-around), check out [black-hole pong](https://github.com/dguto9/gravitational-lensing) or see my attempt at designing a [modular guitar amplifier](https://github.com/dguto9/modular-amp).
