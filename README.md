- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dguto9

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematics, programming across many languages, and games. I especially like to write programs in Arduino for embedded applications, Python for computer programs, as well as making Java Minecraft plugins and videogames in Unity.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in 9th grade and taking precalculus. I have been learning alot about mathematical application in programming, and have spent time writing an algorithm for calculating inverse kinematics as a way to gather a deeper understanding of that before I use it in a project.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at dillongutowski@gmail.com or use any integrated GitHub messaging.

Here are a few of the things I am actively working on:
- Multiplayer game in Unity
- Autonomous Boat (collaboration, pending whether to post the code)
- Nixie tube clock w/ custom circuit board
- Quadrupedal spider robot
- SciFi 3d models in Blender
- Discord learning chatbot

I tend to be bogged down with work on the weekdays and school year, so I may not be active until the summer and weekends.
