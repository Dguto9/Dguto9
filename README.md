I'm Dguto9, or Dillon Gutowski. If you are reading this most of the information will be inaccurate because my interests WILL change (as they continuously do), and I WILL forget to modify this.

So here we go: I have had interest in programming since I was a fourth grader learning Perl from my dad. In the years since, I have attempted many projects in various areas and languages, finishing few but gaining small experience across a variety of topics. For some time I settled in making small games in Unity, but grew bored. Wanting to try something new, I began to use C++, and began work on a variety of projects, relearning all I knew about programming as I had not needed to use many advanced concepts before.

I want to try to get in to Rust at some point and I want to learn how to better structure my projects to post them here.

Here are some projects that I am proud of:
- A nixie tube clock built upon my own PCB
- A matrix library and associated image processing and neural network library
- I contributed to a Wallpaper Engine wallpaper
- I made a few discord chat bots
- Hopefully this list will grow as I make more things that are of presentable quality.
